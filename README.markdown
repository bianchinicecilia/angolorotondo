landing page per la magica Agne, che possa portarle fortuna, amore e fiori.

Thanks to superfab Mike Stevens, who patiently helps me and listen and can fix any bug. Thanks to Sorbo, from Pesaro who knows how to spot all the divs left open and makes me feel closer to home.
Thanks to devcon Lnd, which I'm always shy to ask but knows everything. They're super-pro.
